# SERENE-RISC-s-CyberStats-Challenge

We used data from Statistics Canada's Canadian Cyber Security and Cyber Crime Survey in the 2019 Cyberstats Challenge organized by Serene Risc. Several students in criminology, marketing, statistics or computer science, cybersecurity, participated and used their research skills and creativity to produce informative posters.
My team won the event with the poster in this repository.
