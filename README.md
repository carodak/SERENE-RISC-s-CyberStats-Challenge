# SERENE-RISC-s-CyberStats-Challenge

We used data from Statistics Canada's Canadian Cyber Security and Cyber Crime Survey in the 2019 Cyberstats Challenge organized by Serene Risc. Several students in criminology, marketing, statistics or computer science, cybersecurity, participated and used their research skills and creativity to produce informative posters.
My team won the event with the poster in this repository.

Note: It was a very interesting event, I enjoyed choosing the information we were going to use, being able to use my analytical skills and use my creativity when designing the poster. The GoSecure 2019 conference was also very interesting, I had the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds, it was motivating and a great human experience.
